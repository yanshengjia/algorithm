"""
Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

Given linked list -- head = [4,5,1,9], which looks like following:


Example 1:
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
Output: [4,1,9]
Explanation: You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.


Solution:
Change given node's val to the next node's val and delete the next node
