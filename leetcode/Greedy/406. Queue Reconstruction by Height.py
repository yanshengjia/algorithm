"""
Suppose you have a random list of people standing in a queue. Each person is described by a pair of integers (h, k), where h is the height of the person and k is the number of people in front of this person who have a height greater than or equal to h. Write an algorithm to reconstruct the queue.

Note:
The number of people is less than 1,100.

 
Example

Input:
[[7,0], [4,4], [7,1], [5,0], [6,1], [5,2]]

Output:
[[5,0], [7,0], [5,2], [6,1], [4,4], [7,1]]


Solution:
Sort + Insert
Deal tith tallest people first, then second tallest ... so far and so forath 先处理高的人，放到正确的位置上；再处理第二高的人，以此类推

[[7,0]] (insert [7,0] at index 0)
[[7,0],[7,1]] (insert [7,1] at index 1)
[[7,0],[6,1],[7,1]] (insert [6,1] at index 1)
[[5,0],[7,0],[6,1],[7,1]] (insert [5,0] at index 0)
[[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[7,1]] (insert [5,2] at index 2)
[[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]] (insert [4,4] at index 4)
